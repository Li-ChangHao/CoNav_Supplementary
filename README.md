## 1. Statistics of CoNav Dataset
### 1.1 Destination Objects

There are *41 destination object* in our dataset, which is parsed from HSSD dataset. This set of destination objects covers a diverse range of items within various rooms.

### 1.5 Distribution of navigation trajectory length and episode length

Distribution of navigation trajectory length and episode length in the CoNav dataset. ("Trajectory Length" refers to the geodesic distance of the entire navigation trajectory from the starting position to the target object position. "Episode Length" indicates the number of steps in an episode. The dashed lines represent the respective mean values)
- Left: Distribution of agent navigation trajectory length. 
- Middle: Distribution of humanoid navigation trajectory length. 
- Right: Distribution of episode length. 

This figure showcases the diversity in trajectory lengths and episode lengths. These trajectories include activities with both long and short horizons, providing a more comprehensive reflection of the agent's ability to recognize human intentions and assist in task completion.
